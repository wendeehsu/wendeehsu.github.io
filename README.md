# Wendee's Portfolio

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), hosted on [https://wendeehsu.github.io](https://wendeehsu.github.io)

## First time setup
1. check if we have npm installed via
```
node -v
npm -v
```
if not, you can [download Node.js here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
2. run `npm install` (can delete `package-lock.json` first if exists)
3. run `npm start`

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the local development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
